# Colour-Quantisation-Model
Colour quantisation helps in reducing the distinct colours of an image but makes the new image as visually similar as possible.
This model learns the colours of an image and then uses those colours to reconstruct the same image.

I've used MiniSom for making the self organising maps.

To run, simply cd into the folder and run `python cqm.py`
